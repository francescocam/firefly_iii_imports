- Codebase reviewed: Clean separation of concerns, good error handling, comprehensive documentation
- Dependencies identified: pandas, numpy, click (missing openpyxl for Excel processing)

## Next Steps

- Create architecture.md documenting system design and patterns
- Create tech.md with technology stack and setup instructions
- Verify configuration file structure and defaults
- Test the application with sample data if available
